We write code in our software development, if new developer join and he pull the code,might be code will not works in his machine 
because of versioning conflicting issues.

Here we need docker,
but what is difference between docker and virtual box

VBox is entirely OS, but docker is not it is just a container
that we use it just created an image of it everything any devloper 
anybody who want to work with it, we just give them this container 
and he/she can easily manage it without bothering about installing dependency managing versioning.

As we work with docker and we push code our code will be saved in docker registry, it docker's github.




-Create one local server in our local machine : and run it locally, 
-create one docker file .Dockerfile -> write some configuration
                                    Share the docker : base image,(FROM node:latest)
                                                       Copy file to image( COPY index.js /home/app/index.js
                                                                           COPY package.json /home/app/package.json)
                                                                           WORKDIR /home/app/
                                                                           RUN npm install
                                                                           CMD ["node", "index"]
                                                                           EXPOSE 9000















hub.docker.com

-> docker version
->docker run -it ubuntu
-> docker pull node
docker run -it node
docker build -t myapp . [build file dot -> same directory]
docker run -it myapp     [Sever running insider docker] now expose the port 

This server is running inside the docker,
and now I have to expose it outside the file

docker run -p 3000:9000/ port mapping



Push on docker hub :
docker build -t voyin7/myapp .
now pull the image, create container and push it to the docker hub
docker push voyin7/myapp
docker run -it -p 9000:9000 voyin7/myapp
docker container ls
docker stop id
docker container remove id
docker image ls
coker image rm
